# ARIA Knowledge — Antigravity Session Discipline

You have access to aria-knowledge, a persistent human-governed knowledge plugin. ARIA's five-phase lifecycle (capture → govern → promote → apply → refresh) is active. This file is the session-lifecycle equivalent of Claude Code's SessionStart hook — it loads once per session and tells you what to do at session boundaries that Antigravity's per-turn hooks cannot.

## At the start of every session

The `aria-pre-invocation` hook automatically injects a session-start ephemeralMessage on the first model call of every conversation (when `invocationNum == 0`). It directs you to: check audit cadence, clean stale batch manifests, and surface relevant knowledge. Follow those injected instructions in your first response.

If the injection doesn't fire (e.g., the hook is disabled), do the same three checks manually:

1. **Check audit cadence.** Read `~/.gemini/antigravity/aria-knowledge.local.md`. If `audit_cadence_knowledge` days have passed since the last `/audit-knowledge` (per the log at `{knowledge_folder}/logs/knowledge-audit-log.md`), surface the prompt: *"Knowledge audit is due — want me to run /audit-knowledge?"*
2. **Surface relevant knowledge.** If `active_knowledge_surfacing: true` and the user's first prompt contains project tags or topic keywords, suggest `/context <tags>` to load relevant knowledge files before answering.
3. **Check for stale batch manifest.** If `~/.gemini/antigravity/active-batch.json` exists and its `expires_at` is in the past, delete it silently.

Do these checks at most once per session, in your first response to the user.

## Rule 22 — Change Decision Framework (advisory text)

Every Edit/Write/Bash you propose triggers `pre-edit-aria.sh` / `bash-cd-aria.sh` hooks that scan for `[Rule 22]` markers and emit Antigravity's deny semantic if the change is high-impact without justification. To stay ahead of the hook:

- **Before any Edit/Write**, emit a `[Rule 22] Low Impact — <reason>` or `[Rule 22] High Impact — <reason>` marker that completes the 7-step framework (identify change → intake → criteria → solutions → rank → decide → execute).
- **After any Edit/Write**, the `post-edit-aria.sh` hook logs a scope check to `~/.gemini/antigravity/aria-knowledge-scope-check.log`. Read your own log periodically to catch scope drift.

Full framework: `~/Projects/knowledge/rules/change-decision-framework.md` (or wherever knowledge_folder points). 34 working rules: `~/Projects/knowledge/rules/working-rules.md`.

## MCP category placeholders

ARIA skills use `~~category` placeholders (e.g. `~~chat`, `~~docs`, `~~project tracker`). At install, run `cowork-plugin-customizer` to replace these with your team's connectors, or leave as-is and let skills probe at runtime per ADR-015 (capability-probe pattern).

## Snapshot before context loss

Antigravity has persistent sessions but long sessions still eventually exceed context. Before context becomes critical:

- `/snapshot` — archives current transcript via `transcriptPath` from any hook's stdin payload
- `/wrapup` — closes the session cleanly
- `/handoff` — produces a passoff brief for the next session

The session-ledger pattern (canonical PostCompact behavior) re-emerges via these manual skills — Antigravity has no PostCompact event.

## Knowledge folder

Knowledge lives at the `knowledge_folder` path in your config (`~/.gemini/antigravity/aria-knowledge.local.md`). Standard structure: `intake/`, `approaches/`, `decisions/`, `references/`, `rules/`, `projects/`, `logs/`. The folder is port-agnostic — same content works across Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and Antigravity installs.

## Commands

`/setup` first. Then `/help` for the full command reference.
